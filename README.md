# Principles of Data Analytics - Iris Dataset Exploration

This repository contains my work exploring fundamental principles of data analytics. I'm currently focusing on the classic Iris dataset using Python and the `scikit-learn` library.

## Project Description

In this project, I'm:

* **Loading the Iris Dataset:** Utilizing `scikit-learn`'s `load_iris` function to access the dataset.
* **Analyzing the Dataset:** Examining the structure and characteristics of the Iris data.
* **Initial Exploration:** Displaying the dataset in array format to understand its features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and target variables (species).

## Files

* **`tasks.ipynb`:** A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for loading and exploring the Iris dataset.
* **`README.md`:** This file, provides an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To run the code in `tasks.ipynb`, you'll need:

1.  **Python 3:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook (`pip install notebook`).
3.  **Scikit-learn:** Install the `scikit-learn` library (`pip install scikit-learn`).

Once you have these dependencies, you can:

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Navigate to the repository directory: `cd [repository directory]`
3.  Start Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
4.  Open and run `tasks.ipynb`.

## Further Development

In the future, I plan to:

* Visualize the Iris dataset using various plots (scatter plots, histograms, etc.).
* Apply machine learning algorithms to classify Iris species.
* Explore other datasets and data analytics techniques.
